/* Background on the classes here:
 *
 * Any "tool panels" added to the v_tools or h_tools notebooks in MainWindow must inherit from the
 * ToolPanel class, which is just a wxPanel with some extra virtual methods.
 *
 * The ToolPanelRegistry stores any tool panels which can be created directly (i.e. without any
 * extra input/configuration). Any tools defined in this registry will appear in the tools menu to
 * be instantiated by the user. ToolPanels do not HAVE to be instantiated this way, e.g. another
 * tool could create a panel with some results in it.
 *
 * Tools are added to ToolPanelRegistry by creating an instance of ToolPanelRegistration, usually
 * as a static global in the implementation of that tool.
